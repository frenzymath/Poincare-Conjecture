# Local path-connectedness passes to the domain of a local homeomorphism

A local homeomorphism `p : E → B` identifies a neighbourhood of each point of `E` with an open
subset of `B`, so `E` inherits any property of `B` that is local and stable under passing to open
subspaces. This file records that for local path-connectedness.

The intended use is a covering map, whose total space is therefore locally path-connected as soon
as the base is; this is what lets the covers built over a locally path-connected base be fed back
into results that require a locally path-connected source, such as the lifting criterion.

## Main results

* `IsLocalHomeomorph.locallyPathConnectedSpace`: the domain of a local homeomorphism into a
  locally path-connected space is locally path-connected.
