# `C^n` smoothness of the superposition (Nemytskii) operator

The **superposition** (Nemytskii) operator `N_f : C(K, E) → C(K, F)`, `α ↦ f ∘ α`, is the
operator that turns a nonlinear map `f : E → F` into a map between curve spaces. This file
proves the key analytic fact absent from mathlib:

> **`contDiff_superpositionGen`.** If `f : E → F` is `C^n`, then `N_f : C(K, E) → C(K, F)` is
> `C^n` (as a map of the *Banach spaces* of continuous curves).

This is the linchpin of the smooth dependence of an ODE flow on its initial condition. The flow
`x ↦ σ_x` of `x' = f(x)` is the solution of the Banach fixed-point equation
`picardResidual (x, α) = α - const x - ∫₀ᵗ f(α(s)) ds = 0`
(`FlowDependence.picardResidual`), and that residual is `C^n` in `(x, α)` precisely because the
integrand `α ↦ f ∘ α` is `C^n` — which is what is proved here. The `C^∞` implicit function
theorem then makes the flow `C^∞` in one stroke, with no jet tower.

## The argument

The derivative of the superposition operator is postcomposition by the superposition of the
derivative: along a base curve `α₀`,
`d(N_f)_{α₀} = postcompCurve (t ↦ f'(α₀ t)) = postcompCurve (N_{f'} α₀)`
(`FlowDependence.hasStrictFDerivAt_superposition`, here generalised to an arbitrary target `F`).
Reading this as an equality of *functions of `α`*,
`fderiv (N_f) = postcompCurveL ∘ N_{f'}`,
where `postcompCurveL : C(K, E →L[ℝ] F) →L[ℝ] (C(K,E) →L[ℝ] C(K,F))` is the bounded packaging
of `postcompCurve`. This is the induction: `N_f` is `C^{n+1}` iff its derivative is `C^n`, and
the derivative is `postcompCurveL ∘ N_{f'}`, which is `C^n` because `postcompCurveL` is a
continuous linear map and `N_{f'}` is `C^n` by the induction hypothesis (`f'` is `C^n` when `f`
is `C^{n+1}`). The target space changes at each level (`F ⟹ E →L[ℝ] F`), so the statement is
proved for **all** targets `F` simultaneously.

where global `C^∞` smoothness of `exp_p` is the one remaining input to `thm:dc-ch7-3-1`.

/-- **Math.** **The superposition (Nemytskii) operator of a `C^n` map is `C^n`.** If `f : E → F`

as a map of Banach spaces. Proved by induction on `n`, over **all** target spaces `F`
simultaneously (the derivative superposition has target `E →L[ℝ] F`):

* base `n = 0`: `N_f` is continuous when `f` is (`continuous_superpositionGen`);
* step: `fderiv (N_f) = postcompCurveL ∘ N_{fderiv f}`, which is `C^n` because `postcompCurveL`
  is a continuous linear map and `N_{fderiv f}` is `C^n` by the induction hypothesis
  (`fderiv f` is `C^n` since `f` is `C^{n+1}`); hence `N_f` is `C^{n+1}` by
