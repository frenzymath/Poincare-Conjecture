# Properness via divergent compact exhaustions

do Carmo, *Riemannian Geometry*, Ch. 7, Theorem 2.8, b) ⟺ e): a metric space
has the Heine–Borel property (closed bounded sets are compact, i.e. it is a
*proper* space) iff it admits a monotone exhaustion by compact sets `K n` such
that every sequence escaping all the `K n` diverges in distance from a fixed
base point. This is the purely metric-topological part of the Hopf–Rinow
circle of equivalences; no manifold structure is involved.
