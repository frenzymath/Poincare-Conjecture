# Hausdorffness of fiber bundle total spaces

For a topological fiber bundle `E : B → Type*` with model fiber `F` over a base `B`, the total
space `Bundle.TotalSpace F E` is Hausdorff as soon as both `B` and `F` are. The argument is the
usual "separate along the base, or trivialize and separate in the product" dichotomy:

* if two points of the total space project to distinct points of the base, their preimages
  under the (continuous) projection separate them;
* if they share the same base point, they both lie in the source of the preferred
  trivialization at that point, which is a homeomorphism onto an open subset of `B × F`; pulling
  back disjoint neighbourhoods of their (distinct) images in the Hausdorff space `B × F`
  separates them.

As a corollary, the tangent bundle `TangentBundle I M` of a `C^1` manifold `M` modelled on a
normed space over a Hausdorff base `M` is Hausdorff, since the model fiber (a normed space) is
always Hausdorff.

## Main results

* `FiberBundle.t2Space_totalSpace` — the total space of a fiber bundle over a Hausdorff base
  with Hausdorff model fiber is Hausdorff.
* `TangentBundle.t2Space` — the tangent bundle of a `C^1` manifold over a Hausdorff base is
  Hausdorff.

/-- **Math.** The total space of a (topological) fiber bundle with model fiber `F` over a base
`B` is Hausdorff as soon as `B` and `F` both are. Two points with distinct base projections are
separated by pulling back disjoint open sets around their projections through the continuous
projection map; two points sharing the same base point are separated by pulling back disjoint
open sets around their (distinct) images under the preferred trivialization at that point, which
identifies a neighbourhood of both points with an open subset of the Hausdorff space `B × F`. -/
