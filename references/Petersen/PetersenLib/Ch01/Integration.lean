# Petersen Ch. 1, §1.2 — Integration on Riemannian manifolds

The mechanics of Petersen §1.2's integration remark around the definition
`integrateOnRiemannianManifold` (in `PetersenLib.Ch01.VolumeForm`):

* the reduction of integration over `M` to integration over an open dense
  subset `O ⊆ M` — Petersen: every manifold contains an open dense `O` with
  trivial (hence orientable) tangent bundle carrying an orthonormal frame,
  so integrating over `O` integrates over all of `M`
  (`integrateOnRiemannianManifold_eq_setIntegral_of_dense`);

* the decomposition of the integral through a (finite) smooth partition of
  unity, `∫ f = ∑ᵢ ∫ ρᵢ f`
  (`integrateOnRiemannianManifold_eq_sum_smoothPartitionOfUnity`), and its
  chart-subordinate refinement expressing the integral as a finite sum of
  integrals over chart domains
  (`integrateOnRiemannianManifold_eq_sum_charts`) — the standard mechanism
  by which integration of `f · vol` is computed in local coordinates;

* the existence, on a compact manifold, of a finite smooth partition of
  unity subordinate to chart domains
  (`exists_finite_smoothPartitionOfUnity_isSubordinate_chartAt_source`),
  which feeds the previous decomposition.

## Design notes (the honest gap)

Mathlib has *no* integration of top-degree differential forms on manifolds
and *no* canonical Riemannian volume measure (see the module docstring of
`PetersenLib.Ch01.VolumeForm` and the TODO on
`integrateOnRiemannianManifold`), so as there, all statements are relative
to an explicit measure `μ` on `M` standing in for the measure induced by
`vol_g`. Two consequences:

* In `integrateOnRiemannianManifold_eq_setIntegral_of_dense`, the fact that
  the complement of Petersen's trivializing open dense set is `vol_g`-null
  is *not* a theorem about an arbitrary `μ` (an open dense set can have a
  fat complement), nor is the existence of the trivializing set itself
  formalizable today (no tangent-bundle triviality machinery); nullity of
  the complement is therefore a hypothesis, as is the open-dense-ness
  carried for faithfulness to the remark.

* The partition-of-unity decomposition is stated for a *finite* partition
  (which suffices for compact manifolds, and exists there by
  `exists_finite_smoothPartitionOfUnity_isSubordinate_chartAt_source`);
  the locally-finite infinite case is a routine dominated-convergence
  argument orthogonal to the Riemannian content.

/-- **Math.** Petersen §1.2: every manifold contains an open dense set
`O ⊆ M` on which `TO ≅ O × ℝⁿ` is trivial — in particular `O` is orientable
and carries an orthonormal frame — and integrating over `O` integrates
functions over all of `M`. This lemma is the integration step: if the
complement of `O` is null for the (stand-in) Riemannian measure `μ`, then
the integral over `M` equals the integral over `O`.

The hypotheses `IsOpen O` and `Dense O` record Petersen's setting; the
analytically operative hypothesis is nullity of `Oᶜ` (which holds for the
trivializing set Petersen constructs, its complement being a countable
union of lower-dimensional submanifolds, but *not* for an arbitrary open
dense set — the complement can be a fat Cantor-type set). The existence of
the trivializing `O` itself (a tangent-bundle triviality statement) has no
Mathlib infrastructure and is not formalized here. -/

supported where `ρᵢ` is, so — for a partition subordinate to an atlas
(`integrateOnRiemannianManifold_eq_sum_charts`) — each term is an integral
over a single chart domain, where `f · vol_g` can be computed in
coordinates. -/

sum of integrals over chart domains:
`∫_M f = ∑ᵢ ∫_{chart at cᵢ} ρᵢ f`. Together with
`exists_finite_smoothPartitionOfUnity_isSubordinate_chartAt_source` this
reduces integration on a compact Riemannian manifold to integrals over

/-! ## Existence of chart-subordinate partitions on compact manifolds -/

/-- **Math.** On a compact (Hausdorff) manifold there is a *finite* smooth
partition of unity subordinate to chart domains: finitely many charts cover
`M` by compactness, and Mathlib's `SmoothPartitionOfUnity.exists_isSubordinate`
produces a partition indexed by those charts. This supplies the hypothesis
of `integrateOnRiemannianManifold_eq_sum_charts`, so on a compact Riemannian
manifold integration is always computable chartwise. -/
