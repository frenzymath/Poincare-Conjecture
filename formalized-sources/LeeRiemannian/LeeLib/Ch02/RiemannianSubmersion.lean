Chapter 2, "Riemannian Metrics", §"Riemannian Submersions".

Let `π : M → M'` be a smooth submersion and `g` a Riemannian metric on `M`.
Lee defines, at each `x ∈ M`, the **vertical** tangent space `V x = ker dπ_x`
(the tangent space to the fibre through `x`, which needs no metric) and the
**horizontal** tangent space `H x = (V x)^⊥` (which does).  He then records, as
Proposition 2.25, the three facts that make the theory usable:

* (a) every smooth vector field `W` on `M` splits uniquely as `W = W^H + W^V`
  with `W^H` horizontal, `W^V` vertical, and both smooth;
* (b) every smooth vector field on `M'` has a unique smooth horizontal lift;
* (c) every horizontal vector at a point is the value there of such a lift.

This file develops the pointwise content of all three, and then proves (b) in
full, smoothness included.

The pointwise half is the two subspaces, their complementarity
`T_x M = H_x ⊕ V_x`, the projections `W ↦ W^H` and `W ↦ W^V`, and the horizontal
lift of a single tangent vector characterized as the unique horizontal right
inverse of `dπ_x`.

The smoothness half is the assertion that the horizontal distribution
`x ↦ (ker dπ_x)^⊥` varies smoothly, and it is what
`LeeLib.Ch02.contDiffAt_horizontalLift` was set up to supply.  It is carried out
in the last two sections: `contMDiffAt_horizontalLift` ports that lemma from a
normed-space parameter to a manifold one, and `contMDiffAt_horizontalLiftField`
feeds it the metric and the differential read in local trivializations, giving
Lee's Proposition 2.25(b) as `exists_unique_horizontalLift`.

What is *not* done here is the smoothness half of (a) — that `W^H` and `W^V` are
smooth for a smooth `W` on the total space.  The same trivialization argument
applies (the extra ingredient being that `x ↦ dπ_x (W x)` is smooth in
coordinates), but it is not written.  Part (c) is likewise complete only
pointwise (`horizontalLiftAt_mfderiv_of_mem`); the remaining step is to extend a
single tangent vector `dπ_x v` to a vector field on `M'`.

## The submersion hypothesis

Mathlib has no notion of submersion at all: a grep over the pinned
`Mathlib/Geometry/` finds `IsImmersionAt` (whose `mfderiv` API is entirely TODO)
and nothing else — no regular value theorem, no constant rank theorem, no local
normal form.  So `IsSubmersion` is defined here, directly as surjectivity of
every differential, which is the form Lee actually uses and the form the
horizontal lift needs.  This mirrors the house style of
`LeeLib.Ch02.NormalBundle`, which carries injectivity of `mfderiv` as its
immersion hypothesis for the same reason.

Consequently the fibres are *not* known here to be embedded submanifolds (that
is Lee's appeal to the submersion level set theorem, Corollary A.25), and
`verticalSpace` is defined as `ker dπ_x` rather than as the tangent space to the
fibre.  The two agree, and only the kernel is used below.

## Design

`horizontalSpace` is spelled by the vanishing condition `⟪v, w⟫ = 0` for every
vertical `w`, through `g` itself, rather than as `(verticalSpace π x)ᗮ` — the
same choice `LeeLib.Ch02.NormalBundle.normalSpace` makes, and for the same
reason: `ᗮ` would force every statement to mention the `RiemannianBundle`
instance that installs the fibrewise inner product, whereas the `g`-form needs
no instance at all.

`TangentSpace I x` carries no `NormedAddCommGroup` instance — mathlib withholds
one deliberately, since a norm on the tangent space is exactly the choice of a
metric, and supplying one would create a diamond with `RiemannianBundle`.  But
`LeeLib.Ch02.horizontalLift` needs the model space to be a finite-dimensional
normed space.  The two are reconciled by the definitional equality
`TangentSpace I x = E` (the same "abuse of definitional equality" mathlib itself
relies on in `NormedSpace.fromTangentSpace`): every application of a
`horizontalLift` lemma below pins `(E := E) (E' := E')` so that unification
cannot instead pick `TangentSpace I x`, for which the normed instances do not
exist.  Dropping a pin does not give a wrong theorem, it gives an instance
synthesis failure.

/-! ## Smooth dependence of the horizontal lift on the data

`LeeLib.Ch02.contDiffAt_horizontalLift` says that `horizontalLift (B x) (A x)`
depends smoothly on `x` when `x` ranges over a *normed space*.  The horizontal
lift of a submersion needs `x` to range over the total space `M`, a *manifold*,
so that lemma cannot be applied directly.

`contMDiffAt_horizontalLift` below is the port.  Its proof is the same four
lines — the formula `L = B⁻¹Aᵗ(AB⁻¹Aᵗ)⁻¹` together with smoothness of operator
inversion at invertible operators — with each `ContDiffAt` combinator replaced
by its `ContMDiffAt` counterpart (`ContMDiffAt.clm_comp`, and
`ContDiffAt.comp_contMDiffAt` for the two inversions, whose outer function is a
map of normed spaces even when the parameter is not).  It is strictly more
general than the normed-space version, which is the case `X = EX`, `IX = 𝓘(ℝ, EX)`.

This is the statement that the horizontal distribution `x ↦ (ker dπ_x)^⊥` varies
smoothly, expressed in a trivialization: `B` and `A` are the metric and the
differential read in local trivializations of the tangent bundles, and
`horizontalLift_congr` is what says the lift of the trivialized data is the
trivialized lift. -/

/-! ## Proposition 2.25(b): the horizontal lift of a smooth vector field is smooth

The pieces are now in place.  Fix `x₀ : M`.  Smoothness of a section is a
statement about a local trivialization (`Bundle.contMDiffAt_section`), so write
both the metric and the differential in the trivializations of `T M` at `x₀` and
of `T M'` at `π x₀`:

* `metricInCoordinates g x₀` is `g` so read; it is smooth because that is exactly
  what the `contMDiff` field of a `ContMDiffRiemannianMetric` says, and
  `metricInCoordinates_apply` identifies it as `g` conjugated by the fibre
  trivialization;
* `inTangentCoordinates I I' id π (mfderiv π) x₀` is `dπ` so read, and mathlib's
  `ContMDiffAt.mfderiv_const` says it is smooth — this is the one place where the
  smoothness of `x ↦ dπ_x` enters.

`horizontalLift_congr` then says the lift of this trivialized data *is* the
trivialized lift, and `contMDiffAt_horizontalLift` says the former is smooth.

/-- **The horizontal lift, read in tangent coordinates, is smooth.**

`x ↦ L_x` is a family of linear maps `T_{π x}M' → T_x M` covering `π`, so its
smoothness is a statement about local trivializations of the two tangent bundles.
Read there it is the lift of the trivialized data — that is `horizontalLift_congr`
— which is smooth by `contMDiffAt_horizontalLift`.

This is the form Lee's Theorem 2.28 needs: it hands `L` to
`LeeLib.Ch02.contMDiffAt_bilinearCompOf` as an abstract smooth family of linear
maps, the point being that `L` is *not* the differential of any map, so
`ContMDiffAt.mfderiv_const` does not apply to it. -/

/-- **The horizontal lift of a smooth section along `π` is smooth.**

This is the analytic core of Lee's Proposition 2.25, in the generality both (a)
and (b) need.  A *section along `π`* is a family `X x ∈ T_{π x}M'` — that is, a
section of the pullback bundle `π^*TM'` — and the assertion is that lifting it
fibrewise by `L_x` produces a smooth vector field on `M`.

Stating it for a section along `π` rather than for a vector field on the base is
what makes it serve both halves of 2.25:

* **(b)** is the case `X x = X₀ (π x)` for a vector field `X₀` on `M'`
  (`contMDiffAt_horizontalLiftField` below);
* **(a)** is the case `X x = dπ_x (W x)` for a vector field `W` on `M`, which is
  *not* of the form `X₀ ∘ π` — the vector `dπ_x (W x)` genuinely depends on `x`
  and not merely on `π x`, since `W` need not be `π`-related to anything.

The proof is unchanged from the vector-field version: only the hypothesis moves,
from `Bundle.contMDiffAt_totalSpace` applied to `X ∘ π` to the same lemma applied
to `X` directly.  `Bundle.contMDiffAt_totalSpace` is stated for an arbitrary base
map, so a section along `π` costs nothing over a section over `M'`. -/

smooth vector field is smooth*.

Given a smooth vector field `X` on the base `M'`, the field
`x ↦ horizontalLiftAt g π x (X (π x))` is a smooth vector field on `M`.  Together
with `mfderiv_horizontalLiftAt` (it is `π`-related to `X`),
`horizontalLiftAt_mem` (it is horizontal) and `horizontalLiftAt_unique` (nothing
else is both), this is the whole of Lee's Proposition 2.25(b).

`X ∘ π`, which is smooth because `π` is. -/
